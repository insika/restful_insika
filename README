restful_insika
==============
very simple python testserver for the RESTful INSIKA Interface
--------------------------------------------------------------

this example relies on web.py and has been tested to work with version web.py-0.37

To get started, make sure you have Python 2.x.y installed. 
After typing `python` you should see something like this: 
`Python 2.7.3 (default, Apr 10 2013, 05:46:21) 
[GCC 4.6.3] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>`
If you don't have Python 2.x.y installed, check http://python.org/ for further help. To exit python type `quit()`. 

Change into your workspace directory and clone this repo: `git clone http://github.com/insika/restful_insika`.

Download `web.py-037.tar.gz` from: http://webpy.org/static/ and extract the folder `web` and the files `PKG-INFO` and `setup.py` into the working directory `restful_insika`. 

Change into the working directory: `cd restful_insika` and install web.py: `python setup.py install`.

Start the server by typing: `python restful_insika.py` and point your browser to http://localhost:8080/ . If you want to use another ip address, specify it `python restful_insika.py <ip_addr>`.
